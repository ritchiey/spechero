## Glossary
  Naming things, as the adadge goes, is one of two hard things in computer science (the other being cache-invalidation and off-by-one errors).
  Every software project has its own vocabluary. Make it explicit by creating a glossary of words and terms you use when describing the system.
  Link to these in your introductory docs to help people get up to speed quickly.
